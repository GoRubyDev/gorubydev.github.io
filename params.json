It was a set of CGI scripts which drove a database-powered radio station website. I've worked on much larger backend systems and web applications since then in Java, Python, Ruby, and now I'm converting critical parts of a large Ruby on Rails 3.2 codebase to Go's Revel with great success. It's been so successful, in fact, that I will be going into maintenance mode so I have part-time availability to work on other projects. See *Availability* section below.\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nI will be available (as of Monday September 23, 2013) up to 20 hours per week to work on your Ruby on Rails, Go or a greenfield project. \r\n\r\n### Capabilities\r\n\r\nBelow is a quick list of what I could do for you:\r\n\r\n* Adding functionality to your Ruby on Rails or Sinatra web app\r\n* Fixing bugs in your Ruby on Rails or Sinatra web app\r\n* Migrating critical parts of your Ruby/Rails or Python/Django web apps to a language/runtime/framework that can utilize multi-core servers better, e.g. Go/Revel.\r\n* Building a fresh web application or REST API for your using Go/Revel.\r\n\r\nWhile my core skills are on the Go, Ruby, Python, and C backends, I am fully capable of working on maintaining CSS, Javascript (Ember, Knockout, Angular, jQuery), and automating web asset distributions on CDNs.\r\n\r\n![EmberJS](http://cdn.tutsplus.com/net.tutsplus.com/uploads/2013/07/ember-resources-preview.jpg \"Ember Javascript\") ![KnockoutJS](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/Content/App/icon.png \"Knockout Javascript\") ![AngularJS](http://ih3.redbubble.net/image.13973377.8604/fc,140x140,white.u8.jpg \"Angular Javascript\") ![jQuery](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7SCyYFFnd4Q/TYRdcZzO0pI/AAAAAAAAAL4/7defbkHW6jg/s1600/jquery-logo.jpg \"jQuery Javascript\") \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nEmail me [gorubydev@gmail.com](mailto:gorubydev@gmail.com) to find out how I could assist your software project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
